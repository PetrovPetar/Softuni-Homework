Write a program that deletes town which name is given as an input. Also, delete all addresses that are in those towns. 
Print on the console the number addresses that were deleted. 
You may also note that there are some Employees in that have addresses which may be a problem for deleting the addresses. 
So first off start by setting the AddressID of each employee in for the given address to null. 
After all of them are set to null, you may safely remove all the addresses from the context.
Addresses and finally remove the given town. You may test this task locally, 
so that you can see what happens for more than 1 case of deletion.

Example

Input	    Output
Sofia	    1 address in Sofia was deleted
Seattle  	44 addresses in Seattle were deleted
